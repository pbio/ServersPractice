<h1>This is a simple app that shows a dummy Stock table. </h1>
<p>First it uses a Post request to get the list of stocks and their starting prices. </p>
<p>Next it uses Websockets to get the updated prices of Stocks. </p>
<p>It uses 2 node.js servers: one is just http and the other is a websocket using socket.io.</p>

<h1>Next goal will be integrating React in the code. </h1>
